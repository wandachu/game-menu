# Game Menu

> Game menu includes a bundle of mini games. The menu allows users to type the specific game they would like to play, then display the game for the user.

## Breakout
Use arrow keys to move the paddle to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. Once the player knocks down all bricks, a new game is displayed with one more layer of bricks.

The  player has three lives in each game. If all lives are used, the game will restart with a single layer of bricks.

## Destructo
Use mouse to select any bricks to eliminate and aiming for eliminating as many bricks as possible. All adjacent bricks will be destroyed all together in one single click.

There is animation of bricks falling and merging to the center when bricks are destroyed.

## Maze
Generate a completely random maze in linear time and space using Eller's Maze Generation Algorithm.

From any spot in the maze, the player can find a single path to any other spot. The maze generated is guaranteed to have no cycle or unreachable spot.

## Skunk
Use mouse to interact with the buttons to play a dice-rolling game with the AI (Archie).

In each turn, the player must either pass or roll the current dice. The first player who reaches 100 is the winner.

When it is Archie's turn, Archie will disable one button to force the player to help him click the button per Archie's strategy calculated based on Markov chain.

## Snake
Use left and right arrow keys to control the snake's moving direction and try to eat as many food as possible without walking into the wall or itself. Each time the snake eats a food, it grows a little longer.

The game has a timer and the snake must eat a food before the timer runs out. Otherwise, the snake dies. Each time the snake eats, the timer will increase.

## Sokoban
Use arrow keys to move the warehouse keeper (in green) to move the boxes (in yellow) to the target spots (in light blue)

Currently, the game has two maps. Once the player completes one map, the next level is then unlocked. The user can press space to restart the current level.

## Tetris
Use arrow keys to control the shape to move left or right, rotate, or accelerate the dropping speed.

If any layer is filled, it will be eliminated with an animation showing that such layer will "fly off" the screen.
